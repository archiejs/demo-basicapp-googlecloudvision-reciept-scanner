# AchieJS basic demo - reciept scanning commandline utility

The goal of this demo project is to show how archiejs modules can be piped together
to do a task. In this case, the pipeline is as follows :-

1. Read reciepts from google drive
2. Run OCR on them with google vision
3. Save the results in google docs

This project is also a good way to see how well google vision can handle old washed out
reciepts.
